00:00:00.719 --> 00:00:03.360
hello and welcome back to another lesson

2
00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:05.120
of the web development course

3
00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:08.320
which is all about how to make websites and

4
00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:10.719
introducing you to the three main

5
00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:13.120
programming languages used in it which are

6
00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:16.160
html css and javascript so without

7
00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:18.720
further and due let's get into the third lesson

8
00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.960
but just before we get into that i just

9
00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:22.880
wanted to make something clear

10
00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.119
and that's why i talk in english and

11
00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:27.599
just not any other language out there

12
00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.720
and the reason is because when i actually

13
00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.440
like talk in english you are going to

14
00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:35.520
learn two things simultaneously

15
00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.520
so you will learn english and

16
00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:39.760
programming at the same time so it's just like

17
00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:42.399
killing two birds with one stone and

18
00:00:42.399 --> 00:00:44.719
that's because programming is all in english

19
00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:46.640
so if you know english programming is

20
00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:48.079
going to be much much easier to

21
00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:49.440
understand and comprehend

22
00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.160
so i really suggest you get into english

23
00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.480
to know english just because programming is the same

24
00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:59.680
as talking english but instead of

25
00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:01.840
a person you are talking to a computer

26
00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:04.959
so yeah keep that in mind too

27
00:01:04.959 --> 00:01:09.040
and instead of talking or speaking you are just typing it or

28
00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:13.439
you know writing it down and i don't want to

29
00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.759
take this a bit further but that's just

30
00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:18.000
why i actually talk in english

31
00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.040
the first thing that you should do is

32
00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.040
actually getting the text editor

33
00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.799
and the first one i'm going to type is

34
00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:44.399
going to be sublime as you can see this

35
00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.079
is the download page for it

36
00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.079
and the other one is going to be the

37
00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:49.840
notepad++ which i'm going to put

38
00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:52.000
it in the description right

39
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.840
and if i could just type it you can actually get the 64-bit

40
00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.439
or a 32-bit for your you know machine

41
00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:02.799
and for you know ios users and

42
00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:05.360
android users basically mobiles you can

43
00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.000
actually get this app for ios users

44
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.080
you can write code and css you know javascript

45
00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.000
everything is there you can actually use

46
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.520
it and for android users

47
00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:18.000
i recommend using this app it's great it

48
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.160
even like styles stuff

49
00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:23.280
it's amazing after that's out of the way

50
00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:26.959
i'm gonna type some stuff in the file

51
00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:29.760
and show you how to make the file so

52
00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:30.879
let me just say like

53
00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:35.120
this is some website and actually save it

54
00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.640
i'm just going to save it like all files and then dot

55
00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.080
you know every file has like an

56
00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.920
extension for instance an image has like a jpeg or png

57
00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:47.519
extension at the end of it but

58
00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:51.200
you know html files have html

59
00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:54.239
which makes sense however for web development and

60
00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:58.640
making you know website files and html files it's

61
00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:02.000
really important to have a different name for

62
00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.760
the html or the first html file you actually make

63
00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.800
just because it's a bit important and

64
00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:10.720
i'll show you why in a second

65
00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:13.840
so if we actually just go to our file

66
00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:16.400
which is in this folder where i saved and if

67
00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.159
we drag it and drop it you can see

68
00:03:18.159 --> 00:03:20.239
it opened it and it set like the

69
00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:21.920
directory to the title

70
00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:23.519
and you can see like this is some

71
00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:25.200
website so we can see the content of the

72
00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:26.720
file as a website

73
00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:29.599
however there's a problem as you

74
00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:31.360
can see we did not name it

75
00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:34.400
properly if we actually go

76
00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:37.440
so this is the directory right so if we

77
00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:41.280
open the website or on a domain like google

78
00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:44.000
it won't open the html file directly

79
00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
it's actually just gonna show the directories

80
00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.560
which is really not good because the

81
00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:50.959
user could go through your files you know your

82
00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:54.239
pictures and till the end which is really not good

83
00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:56.959
so you want to fix that problem and

84
00:03:56.959 --> 00:03:58.879
the way you do it is

85
00:03:58.879 --> 00:04:02.959
fairly simple you just name let me just get that back

86
00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:06.560
close that and open the folder

87
00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:09.280
and just rename this to index this is

88
00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:10.799
really important if you

89
00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:15.200
name it index.html and then if i just refresh this

90
00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:18.720
you can see it automatically actually opened it

91
00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:20.959
and if i even like get it to another

92
00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:22.639
window it should do the same

93
00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:26.000
so let me just remove this file and

94
00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.720
get the new one that i renamed in it and

95
00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:31.360
remove this and type some html

96
00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:34.080
so the first that you really just

97
00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:36.160
gonna write is gonna be html i automatically

98
00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:38.639
write it for me because i'm in sublime

99
00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:40.560
and let me just give this a title

100
00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:43.919
so the demo website and save the file and

101
00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:47.199
let me open it in firefox you can see

102
00:04:47.199 --> 00:04:50.240
that i get a title now there's nothing

103
00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:53.520
inside of it so it's just going to be a blank website

104
00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:55.680
and also like this is the demo website

105
00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:57.280
that we are going to make

106
00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:00.320
i've done like a few adjustments but

107
00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:04.400
it's gonna be this so i'm gonna make the whole structure

108
00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:07.120
of html for this you can see like we

109
00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:09.039
will be making this whole thing

110
00:05:09.039 --> 00:05:12.479
making it functional until the end

111
00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:15.520
so let me just give that a refresh

112
00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:19.199
and let's actually give the website an icon

113
00:05:19.199 --> 00:05:23.440
which is going to be a reel equal to icon

114
00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:25.680
and type is going to be image and slash

115
00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:28.400
png just because i have an image

116
00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:31.039
of type png the href is going to be the

117
00:05:31.039 --> 00:05:33.600
directory of the image where you've saved it

118
00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:36.840
so i have a folder of assets and i've named it

119
00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:40.080
favicon you know dash 600

120
00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:43.600
and yeah let me just get that

121
00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:47.039
so wherever your index is that's where you actually like

122
00:05:47.039 --> 00:05:49.440
write the directories for it so i

123
00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:50.720
have an index in here

124
00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:53.919
i can just say like assets and then slash

125
00:05:53.919 --> 00:05:57.600
favicon you know dash 600.

126
00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:01.039
let me just copy that and put it in

127
00:06:01.039 --> 00:06:04.319
and then dot png and if we refresh this now

128
00:06:04.319 --> 00:06:07.759
we should get a favicon or an icon for the website

129
00:06:07.759 --> 00:06:11.120
but let's say your picture is actually not in

130
00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:13.759
the assets let's say it's actually

131
00:06:13.759 --> 00:06:15.120
one directory back

132
00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:18.720
or before your index file if we just

133
00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:23.120
let me just remove the cache just because it's cached

134
00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:25.680
yeah you can see like we are not

135
00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:27.600
getting an icon because it's not in the

136
00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:29.280
assets folder anymore

137
00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:33.039
actually it's one directory back you know

138
00:06:33.039 --> 00:06:35.360
so how do we tell the code to actually

139
00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:36.960
get back one directory

140
00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:39.440
and that is fairly simple you just type

141
00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:41.039
double dots and then slash

142
00:06:41.039 --> 00:06:45.440
and then your file that's literally just gonna get

143
00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:49.120
back one directory and search for your file

144
00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:51.360
and now if i actually refresh this you

145
00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:54.000
can see i get the icon back

146
00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:55.919
and if you have it like two directories

147
00:06:55.919 --> 00:06:57.120
back you can just type

148
00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:59.919
another dot a double dot and slash

149
00:06:59.919 --> 00:07:01.199
it's going to do the same thing

150
00:07:01.199 --> 00:07:04.080
but for me i've saved it in my assets

151
00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:05.360
folder so let me just

152
00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:08.639
get this back to there and

153
00:07:08.639 --> 00:07:11.680
refresh now it should have the same thing

154
00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:13.840
let me just give the site a

155
00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:16.639
description which is going to be a meta tag and

156
00:07:16.639 --> 00:07:19.599
you know the name is going to be

157
00:07:19.599 --> 00:07:21.120
equal to description

158
00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:24.560
and the content is going to be equal

159
00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:26.000
let me actually get it from the demo

160
00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:30.400
website so let me just get back to the start of the url and

161
00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:33.840
type view source and column

162
00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:36.800
we should get you know the source code

163
00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:39.680
and then just copy this description and get it back to

164
00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:43.280
the tutorial code and that should do the job

165
00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:44.879
so then the next one is just going to be

166
00:07:44.879 --> 00:07:48.160
a meta tag type of viewport let me just copy that

167
00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:51.440
paste it in and that should do the job

168
00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:55.039
so i've done the head so now we should do the body

169
00:07:55.039 --> 00:07:56.560
so the first section i'm going to ever

170
00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:59.199
make is going to be the header you know

171
00:07:59.199 --> 00:08:00.720
so let me actually view it in this way so

172
00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:02.720
you can see so it's just gonna have

173
00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:06.160
you know two sections or two divs

174
00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:07.759
the first one is gonna hold the you know

175
00:08:07.759 --> 00:08:09.599
the logo and this image and the other

176
00:08:09.599 --> 00:08:11.680
one is just gonna have these links

177
00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:15.120
so let me just make the header tag and as i said

178
00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:18.000
the header tag will have like two divs

179
00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:22.000
so let me make the first div so inside of this div

180
00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.639
we'll just have like an anchor tag

181
00:08:24.639 --> 00:08:28.240
and the content of it is gonna be web dev course

182
00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:29.520
and the other one is just gonna be an

183
00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:32.719
img tag which will have like a source

184
00:08:32.719 --> 00:08:35.679
and equal to assets slash menu dot png

185
00:08:35.679 --> 00:08:36.958
just because that's where i

186
00:08:36.958 --> 00:08:38.880
saved my file and the other div is just

187
00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:40.880
gonna have a bunch of this links

188
00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:44.000
so it's just gonna be a nav tag and

189
00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:45.839
inside of this nav tag i'm gonna have a

190
00:08:45.839 --> 00:08:47.120
bunch of anchor tags

191
00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:48.480
so the first one is gonna be home let me

192
00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:50.880
just copy this a few times

193
00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:54.560
yes and the second one is going to be work

194
00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:57.920
the third one is going to be about if i

195
00:08:57.920 --> 00:09:00.160
can type it right and the fourth one is

196
00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:02.160
going to be contact

197
00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:03.839
and that should do the job so this is

198
00:09:03.839 --> 00:09:05.760
the same thing as in demo website

199
00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:08.480
however the image is too big let me fix that

200
00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:11.760
so i'm just gonna say width & equal it to 100%

201
00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:13.760
however i'm gonna change this back

202
00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:16.080
i'm gonna remove this and do it in css

203
00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:19.839
but let me show you just what it does so if i just

204
00:09:19.839 --> 00:09:23.040
you know change the image source to be bulb

205
00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:25.920
dash off you can see like if i don't

206
00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:29.360
have this width thing it's gonna be really big and gigantic

207
00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:32.640
you can actually like fit it in the website so

208
00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:34.880
let me just get that back i hope that

209
00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:37.760
actually like showed what i was

210
00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:39.839
meaning so the other section is just

211
00:09:39.839 --> 00:09:41.120
gonna be having this bulb

212
00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:44.320
and you know this puzzle thing

213
00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:47.519
where you have to like fix the circuit

214
00:09:47.519 --> 00:09:49.600
so it's just gonna be another div and

215
00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:51.360
it will have like a div

216
00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:54.640
and an img for it so the img is

217
00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:55.920
going to be the bulb off

218
00:09:55.920 --> 00:10:01.040
again and if we actually refresh we can see it

219
00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:04.320
right there and the first div we'll just have like

220
00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:07.440
this alert thing and then this puzzle inside of it

221
00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:11.120
so let me just make another div for that alert

222
00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:13.120
and let me just copy it and paste it

223
00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:15.519
over and it will have

224
00:10:15.519 --> 00:10:20.399
like another div let me just type it

225
00:10:20.399 --> 00:10:22.560
and it will just have like an svg

226
00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:23.920
element inside of it

227
00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:26.640
svgs are really great as you can see

228
00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:30.640
so svgs are much different than

229
00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:34.079
you know images and other stuff because

230
00:10:34.079 --> 00:10:37.680
like you can do a lot with them you can animate them and

231
00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:40.240
they're always there as you can see you

232
00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:42.000
can make them with a lot of softwares

233
00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.079
and other programs but i'd rather

234
00:10:44.079 --> 00:10:46.720
use a you know a website like this one

235
00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:48.560
and as you can see i've made

236
00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:51.760
all of that design with just fairly simple

237
00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:53.519
shapes and you can actually export them

238
00:10:53.519 --> 00:10:58.000
as svgs so let me just get out of here

239
00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:01.920
just copy it from the source code and

240
00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:04.399
paste it over here

241
00:11:04.399 --> 00:11:07.200
let me just turn off the word wrap so

242
00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:08.640
you can see it better

243
00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:12.399
and yeah so this is the same thing

244
00:11:12.399 --> 00:11:16.560
as in actually the demo website and let me actually

245
00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:19.839
remove that id equels rotate just because

246
00:11:19.839 --> 00:11:21.760
it is responsible for you know

247
00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:23.839
rotating that puzzle thing

248
00:11:23.839 --> 00:11:27.360
that i'm going to do in the javascript lesson

249
00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:31.839
and let me fix that so width equals

250
00:11:31.839 --> 00:11:35.040
100% and now it should be looking great

251
00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:37.279
so this section is going to be having

252
00:11:37.279 --> 00:11:39.040
this another thing but before that we

253
00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:40.560
have like a horizontal line when we

254
00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:41.760
actually remove that

255
00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:45.920
it pops up so it like divides or splits the whole

256
00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:48.240
two sections and then we have

257
00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:50.959
like this X and then this Note

258
00:11:50.959 --> 00:11:52.480
so first let me just get that

259
00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:54.560
horizontal line done it's going to be a div

260
00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:57.839
and then we will have like another div

261
00:11:57.839 --> 00:11:59.440
and then inside of that they will have

262
00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:01.279
another one and then an X

263
00:12:01.279 --> 00:12:04.480
for that X button and then we have this note

264
00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:07.760
which is really fairly simple it's another div

265
00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:10.000
and we have like another div for

266
00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:11.440
positioning purposes and

267
00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:13.680
another p inside of it let me just copy

268
00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:18.160
that and bring it to the p tag and if we refresh this

269
00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:20.079
you'll see or you'll notice that it's

270
00:12:20.079 --> 00:12:22.240
not the same as in our demo website

271
00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:25.360
the note is bigger the v is smaller but

272
00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:29.279
in ours it's basically the same so if we look

273
00:12:29.279 --> 00:12:30.880
into the source code you'll see

274
00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:34.079
like i've used some other tags to

275
00:12:34.079 --> 00:12:36.560
get away with that i didn't talk

276
00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:37.839
about them because i did not think they

277
00:12:37.839 --> 00:12:40.160
are that important but let me just write them down

278
00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:43.120
and tell you what they do so if we just

279
00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:45.519
get a b tag and then a

280
00:12:45.519 --> 00:12:48.480
big tag and put the note inside of it

281
00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:50.079
and if we refresh it will make it

282
00:12:50.079 --> 00:12:53.600
bigger and bolder and that's basically what it does

283
00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:55.600
and we can do the same for the v

284
00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:59.760
which is just going to be a small tag and

285
00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:02.800
we will put the v inside of it let me

286
00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:04.800
just do it for all of them

287
00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:07.200
and if we refresh you can see the v is

288
00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:10.399
smaller and the note is bigger and bolder

289
00:13:10.399 --> 00:13:13.760
the other section is just gonna be having

290
00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:16.800
the alert for that section and then

291
00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:19.279
bunch of inputs and a button so first

292
00:13:19.279 --> 00:13:20.399
let me do the alert

293
00:13:20.399 --> 00:13:22.560
which is just like another div let me just copy

294
00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:24.240
that and put it in

295
00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:27.600
and that's it the other section

296
00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:30.639
is gonna be two sections

297
00:13:30.639 --> 00:13:34.000
one for the inputs and one for the button

298
00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.160
so it's just going to be a div and then

299
00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:38.480
two divs inside of it

300
00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:40.480
and i'm just going to do the check

301
00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:41.839
button just because it's easier

302
00:13:41.839 --> 00:13:42.639
it's just going to be a

303
00:13:42.639 --> 00:13:44.800
div and a button inside of it and the

304
00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:48.480
type of the button is going to be equal to button

305
00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:52.800
and the content is going to be just check

306
00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:54.639
and if we look into it we should see the

307
00:13:54.639 --> 00:13:56.639
button right over there

308
00:13:56.639 --> 00:14:00.320
so the other one is going to be having the input

309
00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:02.320
so the input is just going to be a type

310
00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:05.199
of number and we won't need the name let me remove that

311
00:14:05.199 --> 00:14:08.480
we will need the placeholder which is equal to one

312
00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:10.000
and then we have another thing which is

313
00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:11.519
value but you can see

314
00:14:11.519 --> 00:14:14.959
the gray one is the placeholder so i just want to

315
00:14:14.959 --> 00:14:17.120
you know equal the value to be one so

316
00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:19.040
it's automatically always one when

317
00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:22.959
the user opens it and we have another

318
00:14:22.959 --> 00:14:25.760
tag which is going to be the b i'm

319
00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:26.800
going to put these

320
00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:28.639
math signs inside of it the first one is

321
00:14:28.639 --> 00:14:30.959
going to be multiplication

322
00:14:30.959 --> 00:14:34.800
and let me just copy this a few times

323
00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:39.519
so and the second is just going to be division

324
00:14:39.519 --> 00:14:42.880
and the third is going to be plus and

325
00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:47.600
subtract and equal and we'll have another tag

326
00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:51.040
that will just hold the results inside of it

327
00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:55.199
if we look at the results we should have

328
00:14:55.199 --> 00:14:57.040
the whole thing looking the same but

329
00:14:57.040 --> 00:14:59.120
we won't have any results just because i am

330
00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:01.199
going to calculate them with javascript

331
00:15:01.199 --> 00:15:02.800
as you can see in the source code we

332
00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:05.519
have like an id equal to input

333
00:15:05.519 --> 00:15:08.800
and that's just going to be it for that so

334
00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:10.399
the other section is just going to be a

335
00:15:10.399 --> 00:15:14.560
footer which will have like two sections basically

336
00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:18.079
so let me just make a footer

337
00:15:18.079 --> 00:15:21.360
element and then we'll have like two divs inside of it

338
00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:24.079
and the second div which will just be

339
00:15:24.079 --> 00:15:26.399
the copy right thing i'm going to do that first

340
00:15:26.399 --> 00:15:29.920
just because it's easier we'll have like a p

341
00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:33.199
tag let me copy that in

342
00:15:33.199 --> 00:15:35.440
and an anchor tag so you can actually

343
00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:38.160
direct the user to anywhere on the internet

344
00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:41.279
i will just direct them to my instagram account and

345
00:15:41.279 --> 00:15:45.920
it's just gonna be inside of a new blank window

346
00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:51.600
so let me just equal the target to be under score blank

347
00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:54.480
and the content is gonna be Jihad Kurdo

348
00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:56.079
so if we just get back and refresh

349
00:15:56.079 --> 00:15:59.040
we should see the div right there and we

350
00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:00.720
have like a link and if we tap it

351
00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:02.399
it should open the link in a new

352
00:16:02.399 --> 00:16:05.600
window and now let's do the

353
00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:09.279
the first div which is just going to be another div and

354
00:16:09.279 --> 00:16:12.959
we'll have another div underneath it

355
00:16:12.959 --> 00:16:14.800
which will just hold the

356
00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:17.519
you know the links so the first div will

357
00:16:17.519 --> 00:16:20.240
have like another div and inside of that div we'll have

358
00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:22.480
an anchor tag the content is just

359
00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:24.160
gonna be web dev course

360
00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:27.839
and under that we'll just have a p tag that will hold

361
00:16:27.839 --> 00:16:32.720
the description let me just copy it and paste it in

362
00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:34.639
and if we just go back and look at it we

363
00:16:34.639 --> 00:16:36.639
should see it right there

364
00:16:36.639 --> 00:16:40.720
i'll just have another div for positioning purposes

365
00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:44.320
and let me just copy these from the nav tag

366
00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:47.680
just because they are right there and they are the same

367
00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:50.800
and let me position them

368
00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:54.480
right and that's it this is the same structure

369
00:16:54.480 --> 00:16:57.279
for the demo website and there you go

370
00:16:57.279 --> 00:17:00.240
and with that we are done with the third lesson as well

371
00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:02.240
where we actually just write the whole

372
00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:04.000
structure for the demo website

373
00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:06.640
i hope you liked the video and

374
00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:08.319
learned something in the process

375
00:17:08.319 --> 00:17:10.319
